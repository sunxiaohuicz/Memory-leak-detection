\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on memory leak detection with complex control flows. We propose a projection-based approach to increase the accuracy in detecting memory leaks in C source code. We implement a detection tool named PML\_Checker, and evaluate our approach by comparing with three open-source tools %(CppCheck, Splint, RL\_Detector) 
on real-world repositories%(SPEC CPU $2000$, SIR)
, public benchmarks and CC code. Experimental results show that our approach has lower false negatives than three other approaches, especially in C source code with complex control flows and complex data types. The future direction is to improve our approach in terms of scalability. Specifically, it is possible to improve the detection accuracy by combining with other static methods such as data flow analysis.
